		<p> I am graduating from Loyola University Chicago with a bachelors degree in Computer Science.

			I am dying to get involved in the video game business.

		<h2> My Work:	
		<h3>Rhythm Knight</h3>
		<p> My team and I created a rhythm game using python and pyGame for our game design class.  I conceptualized the game, and worked on some of the programming.
			I also created the music and designed the level, along with all the menus.</p>
            <hr>
